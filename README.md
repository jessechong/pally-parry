Final Project: Palindrome Partitioning (PalPar)

Hello, this is the readme file for my project "Palindrome Partitioning" or in short "PalPar".
This project structure was created as per the Stack Quick Start Guide: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#start-your-new-project

This is the file structure of this project: (TODO)
-- PalParFinalProject
---- README
---- palPar.hs
---- palParTest.hs
---- Tests
------ ValidCases
-------- <...various valid test cases saved as .txt files...>
------ InvalidCases
-------- <...various invalid test cases saved as .txt files...>

(TODO)
"palPar.hs" is the main file which contains the logic for this project.
"palParTest.hs" is an HUnit testing file used to thoroughly test various cases.

Please see either file for a more detailed description, instructions to run the file itself,
and the references used for the code written in that file.

Special thanks to Professor Edwards for the class and to Max Helman for TA'ing me over the project.
I had a lot of fun learning about Haskell and working on the homeworks.
